EXPLAIN THE PURPOSE OF EACH LINE
    'Assignment statement'
    'Declare' (a variable)
    'Initialize' (it to some value)'
    'Counted loop'
    'Looping through ___, incrementing by ___'
    'Casting' ("Casting is the process of changing type")
     ^ Why are we casting?
    Mention type

Copy the code into another file; one version is just commented for learning while the
other is commented for understanding. Jump between them in the video

For the simple tool, you could add a trace table into the comments
If there's a Python function that abstracts the function of the simple tool (eg. a
base_convert(a,b) function, mention that)
